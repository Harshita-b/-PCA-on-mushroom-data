# PCA on Mushroom Data

## Overview
PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while preserving as much variance as possible. In this project,PCA is applied on the Mushroom dataset to explore its characteristics and visualize its reduced dimensions.

## Dataset
The Mushroom Data dataset used in this project contains information about various attributes of mushrooms, such as cap shape, cap color, gill size, and more. The goal is to explore the underlying structure of the dataset and potentially discover patterns or clusters within the data using PCA.

## Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
